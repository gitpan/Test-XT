NAME
    Test::XT - Generate best practice author tests

SYNOPSIS
      use Test::XT 'WriteXT';
      
  WriteXT(
          'Test::Pod'            => 't/pod.t',
          'Test::CPAN::Meta'     => 't/meta.t',
          'Test::MinimumVersion' => 't/minimumversion.t',
      );

DESCRIPTION
    A number of Test modules have been written over the years to support
    authors. Typically, these modules have standard short test scripts
    documented in them that you can cut and paste into your distribution.

    Unfortunately almost all of these cut-and-paste test scripts are wrong.

    Either the test script runs during install time, or it runs with an
    out-of-date version of the test module, or the author adds the test
    modules as an (unnecesary) dependency at install time, or for automated
    testing.

    Test::XT is a module intended for use in code generators, release
    automation and other ancillary systems. It generates an appropriate test
    script for various testing modules that runs in the appropriate mode for
    each type of execution environment.

    1. End User Install

    At installation time, test scripts should never ever run, even if the
    test modules are installed and available.

    2. Automated Testing

      # Enable automated testing
      $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} = 1

    During automated testing we should run the tests, but only if the
    testing module are already installed and at the current/latest version.

    However, we should not install dependencies during automated testing,
    because failing to install a testing dependency means less runs on your
    code when the entire point of the author tests is to improve the
    standard of testing, not reduce it.

    3. Release/Author Testing

      # Enable author tests
      $ENV{RELEASE_TESTING} = 1;

    All tests should run at release time by the author. Despite this, the
    dependencies STILL should not be checked for in your Makefile.PL or
    Build.PL, because you could end up accidentally having these extra
    dependencies bleed through into your published META.yml.

    This would cause inaccuracies in tools that track dependencies across
    the entire repository via the META.yml files.
